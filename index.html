        <h1>Here's a time line of Nelson Mandela's life</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Nelson Mandela, in full Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, byname Madiba,
              (born July 18, 1918, Mvezo, South Africa
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In 1944 he joined the African National Congress (ANC), a
              Black-liberation group, and became a leader of its Youth League.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In 1952 in Johannesburg, with fellow ANC leader Oliver Tambo,
              Mandela established South Africaâ€™s first Black law practice,
              specializing in cases resulting from the post-1948 apartheid
              legislation
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Starting in 1952, he was intermittently banned (severely
              restricted in travel, association, and speech)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In December 1956 he was arrested with more than 100 other people
              on charges of treason that were designed to harass antiapartheid
              activists. Mandela went on trial that same year and eventually was
              acquitted in 1961
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In October 1963 the imprisoned Mandela and several other men were
              tried for sabotage, treason, and violent conspiracy in the
              infamous Rivonia Trial, named after a fashionable suburb of
              Johannesburg where raiding police had discovered quantities of
              arms and equipment at the headquarters of the underground Umkhonto
              we Sizwe
